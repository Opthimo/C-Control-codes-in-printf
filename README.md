# Control Sequences and Escape Codes

## 1) Introduction

Modern terminal emulations trace their origins back to **teletype** machines (abbreviated as **tty**), which have been in use since the early 20th century. These machines not only transmitted regular Latin characters from one machine to another but also included mechanisms to **control** certain functionalities of the receiving machine.

One of the simplest examples of such control is the **line feed**. When a user typing on a teletype wanted to start a new line, the receiving machine needed a way to interpret this request correctly. This was achieved by transmitting a specific bit pattern over the communication channel.

This concept of **control sequences** extended beyond simple line breaks. Early tty systems implemented special codes for **carriage return**, **bell sounds**, and **tabulation**, improving user interaction with the machine. As computing technology advanced, these control sequences evolved to support additional functionalities such as **cursor movement**, **text color changes**, and **screen clearing**, laying the foundation for what we now recognize as **ANSI escape codes**.

With the advent of **video terminals** in the 1970s, particularly the introduction of the **DEC VT100**, a standardized set of **escape sequences** was developed. These sequences, prefixed with the **ESC** (escape) character, enabled advanced text formatting and interaction within the terminal. Even today, modern terminal emulators continue to support many of these commands, making them essential tools for developers and system administrators.

A deep understanding of these sequences enables better control over output formatting, automation, and even the creation of interactive command-line interfaces.

Today, these control characters remain in use and are part of the **basic execution character set** as defined by the **C ISO Standard**. Using these characters requires incorporating them into strings. Since they do not have visible representations, C and most other programming languages use **escape sequence notation**, prefixed with a backslash (`\`).

### Examples of Escape Sequences in C:

- `\n` – Line Feed (moves the cursor to the next line)
- `\r` – Carriage Return (moves the cursor to the beginning of the line)
- `\t` – Horizontal Tab (inserts a tab space)
- `\b` – Backspace (moves the cursor one character back)
- `\a` – Bell (produces an audible alert)

These sequences allow fine-grained control over text formatting, making them invaluable in both **system programming** and **interactive command-line applications**.

## 2) Tasks

1. **Add Escape Sequences to `printf`**: Write a program that prints "Hello World" to the command line. Add a trailing `\n` to ensure proper line formatting.
   
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main() {
       printf("Hello World\nHello World\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Use `\t` in Hello World**: Modify the program to include tab characters (`\t`) between words and observe the formatting effects.

3. **Create a List of Escape Sequences**: Make a list of all standard escape sequences and their uses in your own words. Use the provided reference link to experiment with each one.

4. **Write Examples for All Escape Sequences**: Implement a program that demonstrates each escape sequence. You can write separate programs for each sequence or combine multiple sequences in a single program.

5. **Experiment with ANSI Escape Codes**: Try using ANSI escape codes for colored text output, cursor movement, and screen clearing. Research additional codes beyond the basic ones.

## 3) Questions

1. Which escape sequences did not work on your machine? Which ones did?

Linux: \r and \n works

2. How can you use `\r` (carriage return) to overwrite a line in the terminal?

\r jumps to the first place of the actual line.

3. What is the difference between `\n` (line feed) and `\r` (carriage return), and how does their behavior differ across operating systems?

\n jumps to the next line, \r sets the curor to the first place. Some Terminals need both

4. How do ANSI escape codes extend the functionality of basic control sequences?

You can skip line, uses tabs, delete characters,etc.

## 4) Advice

Escape sequences are essential for creating well-structured and readable terminal outputs. A strong understanding of these sequences allows for better user experience in command-line applications. They are especially useful in **logging systems**, **progress indicators**, and **interactive shell programs**. Experimenting with ANSI escape codes will help you unlock even more powerful text formatting capabilities.
